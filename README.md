# Quiz

Extremely minimalistic HTML/JS script flashcard app.
* Computer is recommended (unless you can type fast on a phone or something).
* How to use: Copy the `<body>` format of one of the existing quizzes, then supply a JS object of question/answer mappings and whether it is case insensitive.
* CSS is completely customizable. The only requirement is a question, answer, and stats tag (see HTML for details).

Existing quizzes:
* [Baybayin (Tagalog)](https://lukearcamo.github.io/quiz/baybayin)
* [Russian Cyrillic](https://lukearcamo.github.io/quiz/russian)
* [International radiotelephony spelling alphabet (NATO phonetic alphabet)](https://lukearcamo.github.io/quiz/nato)

Long-term to-do:
* Support for multiple correct answers (unfortunately JS object keys must be unique)
* A way to view all question-answer pairs in a grid
* Instead of typing answers, have button options like Kahoot or Duolingo
* More quiz ideas: Morse code, periodic table, other writing systems

(by that point i can no longer call this minimalistic lol, also most of these are unlikely to be implemented bc im lowkey done, i honestly just wanted a quick way to learn new hyperfixations but we'll see...)
