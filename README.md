# Quiz

Extremely minimalistic HTML/JS script flashcard app.
* Computer is recommended (unless you can type fast on a phone or something).
* How to use: Copy the `<body>` format of one of the existing quizzes, then supply a JS object of question/answer mappings and whether it is case insensitive.
* CSS is completely customizable. The only requirement is a question, answer, and stats tag (see HTML for details).

Existing quizzes:
* Baybayin (Tagalog)
* Russian Cyrillic
* International radiotelephony spelling alphabet (NATO phonetic alphabet)
